        <h1>I am a software engineer at the beginning of my career</h1>
        <p>I am currently studying software engineering through the Auckland University of Technology. <br>
        
            I began programming at the end of 2022 once I finsihed my postgraduate degree in Forensic Science. <br>
            I began building websites and applications for my friends, family and for personal use. <br>
            Recently I have been taking on clients to build professional websites for their businesses.</p>
